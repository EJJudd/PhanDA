/*
 * In PLRM2, save objects are simple, not composite.  Consequently, we
 * cannot use their natural representation, namely a t_struct pointing to an
 * alloc_save_t, since we aren't willing to allocate them all in global VM
 * and rely on garbage collection to clean them up.  Instead, we assign each
 * one a unique "save ID", and store this in the alloc_save_t object.
 * Mapping the number to the object requires at most searching the local
 * save chain for the current gs_dual_memory_t, and this approach means we
 * don't have to do anything to invalidate save objects when we do a
 * restore.
 *
 * In PLRM3, Adobe did the reasonable thing and changed save objects to
 * composite.  However, this means that 'restore' must treat save objects on
 * the stack differently in LL2 vs. LL3 (yes, the Genoa LL2 and LL3 tests
 * require this!).  See zvmem.c:restore_check_stack.
